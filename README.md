Yet Another Mathe Trainer

A simple mathematics trainer, with voice output and basic mathe operations.

## Prerequisites
* A working tts installation (either espeak on linux, cortana on windows or google tts) - control your choice by placing the comments in the code.
* Pandas is used for high scores and statistics, since it is usually availlable. If you don't want this, just deactivate the high score part.
* 

# Usage
Place both files in the same folder, modify yamatra.py to your convinience - there is no extra config file yet :( 
then run python yamatra.py and start the training.
Have Fun.
